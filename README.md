# agar.io-python
There are two versions of agar.io in this repository.

Agar.io Singleplayer is the version with bots, but there is no server, and thus only one user can play together.

The Agar.io Client and Server do not have bots, but multiple users can join the same server. Run the server file on the most powerful computer, and connect all the clients to that IP address.
